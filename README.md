# Uses
This is a module meant to slot into any standard speeduino v0.3, v0.4, and NO2C boards. 
It uses the normal trigger signal conditioner pinout. 
It is ideal for use in a coil negative trigger setup, for example for a car like Suzuki Samurai.

# Single channel
Single channel version only conditions VR1+. ECM jumpers should be configured the same as for VR operation routing the trigger singal into the conditioner module.

# Dual Channel
Same as single channel but for both VR1+ and VR2+ pins. VRx- pins are no connect.
No idea where this would be useful but it's a thing.
PCB coming soon
